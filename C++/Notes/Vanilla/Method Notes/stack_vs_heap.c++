/* STACK
int x = 10;       // Allocated on the STACK
int* p = &x;      // Pointer to stack memory (no 'new' here!)

Combine with Constructor:
Dog* dog = new Dog("Fluffy", "Shepherd", 2);

This calls the Dog constructor, creates the object on the heap, and gives you back a pointer.
You must use delete dog; later to call the destructor and clean up memory.

| **Lifetime** | Auto-deletes at function end | You manage manually                 |
| **Syntax**   | Simple: `int x = 5;`         | Explicit: `int* p = new int(5);`    |
| **Storage**  | Local vars, function calls   | Dynamic objects, big data           |
